Credit to Creation Tumblr Theme
===============================

With photographers in mind.

Elegant and super-duper modern, Credit to Creation aims to be simple without being boring. The typography is relaxed and readable while photos are displayed in a grid format up to just over 500 pixels wide on index pages. Clicking a photo, shows the viewer a larger, 900 pixel wide view along with the image tags and notes. Nothing gets in the way of your creative expression.

## Features

+ fully responsive (the theme will look good and work well on a device of any size)
+ semantic HTML5 markup (supports _modern_ web browsers)
+ column layout (3 columns for wide screens, 2 & 1 columns for smaller screens)
+ supports custom header image
+ custom colors and typography
+ utilizes Tumblr variables
+ custom description
+ easy Google Analytics & Disqus commenting (optional)

### Google Analytics

Support for Google Analytics tracking is built in and ready to go. Just create a new property for your blog in your Google Analytics account, and then paste the Property ID into the theme options.

### Disqus Commenting

Similar to Google Analytics, simply paste your [Disqus Shortname](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208) into the theme options to enable Disqus.

### Customization

While Credit to Creation is designed to be elegant and usable out of the box, there is plenty for you to customize. Options include typographic details (such as fonts), enabling or disabling like & reblog buttons shown above photos, layout options and more.

Credit to Creation allows you to load an extra 2 pages worth of content onto a single page. Just enable the "Show Extra Content From Subsequent Pages" option from the "Theme Options" menu on the customize page. Keep in mind loading extra content on all of your index pages, will make those pages load a little slower.
